-->Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a population-based metaheuristic that can be used to find approximate solutions to difficult optimization problems.
-->The solution construction process is stochastic and is biased by a pheromone model, that is, a set of parameters associated with graph components (either nodes or edges) 
   whose values are modified at runtime by the ants.

Working of Ant Colony Optimization::

1)First, each ant in the colony constructs a solution based on previously deposited pheromone trails. 
2)Next ants will lay pheromone trails on the components of their chosen solution, depending on the solution’s quality.
3)An ant will often follow the strongest pheromone trail when constructing a solution. 
4)However, for the ant to consider solutions other than the current best, a small amount of randomness is required in its decision process.
5)In addition to this, a heuristic value is also computed and considered helping to guide the search process towards the best solutions. 
6)In the example of the multiple traveling salesman problem this heuristic will typically be the length of the edge between the destinations being considered - the shorter 
  the edge, the more likely an ant will pick it.
